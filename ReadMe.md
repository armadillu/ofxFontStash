# ofxFontStash: Dynamic font glyph cache for OpenGL

Quick and simple Addon wrapping [Font-Stash](https://github.com/akrinke/Font-Stash). 

"Font Stash enables easy string rendering in OpenGL applications. It supports truetype fonts and UTF-8 encoded localized strings. All glyphs are cached in OpenGL texture atlases. Font rasterization is done using Sean Barrett’s stb_truetype.h."

Main Features:

* fast
* draw unicode strings
* mipmapped font textures, scale down your text and it still looks ok
* kerning 
* draw text columns, limit number of lines in column
* shitty api (sorry!)

I made tiny modifications to FontStash to render text flipped vertically, to play nicer in the OpenFrameworks universe in general. It will also report every time a new texture is created.

ofxFontStash supports basic one-line text drawing, lineHeight, multiline text rendering based on '\n', and also word wraping to draw a paragraph constrained to a certain width. It also offers bbox calculations on all the drawing options. It requires [ofxUnicode](http://github.com/bakercp/ofxUnicode).

I made some further modifications to fontstash to allow the creation of mipmaps, and to enable the use of the font-specified kerning information, so spacing between character pairs is shown as its designer intended.

ofxFontStash is quite [fast](http://www.flickr.com/photos/armadillu/7268071284/sizes/o/in/photostream/) at drawing text. If you need to draw a left-aligned text column of a certain width, ofxFontStash can be [~10x faster](http://www.flickr.com/photos/armadillu/9574047566/sizes/o/in/photostream/) than ofxFTGL.
